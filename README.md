# COMP1406-Java
Java Code from my assignments and tutorials

# Assignment 3
A JavaFX program that takes the electronic store classes from Assignment 2 and implements them using a GUI. <br />
• Lets users buy items from the store using buttons and ListViews. <br />
• Updates a most popular items ListViews based on what the user has bought. <br />
• Updates other displayed information such as number of purchases and revenue.

#  Assignment 2
A Java assignment that applies the OOP principles of encapsulation and inheritance to redesign the electronic store classes from Assignment #1.

# Assignment 1
A simple Java assignment that simulates an electronic store. The user is prompted to search for an item that is currently on display in the store, the program will then let the user know if the item in the search result is available. Uses classes to store each of the different objects within the store.
